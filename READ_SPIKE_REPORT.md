# Spike Report

## Spike Description

Explore the various techniques for the creation of block chains like Hyperledger, Ethereum, R3 Corda and Ripple. To find their pros and cons and eventually to come up with the decision to find which platform is best suited for the project.

## Pros and Cons

Out of the main platforms to develop block chains there are pros and cons of all the platforms.

## Hyperledger

### Pros
* The biggest positive point of the Hyperledger that I found was the ability to create private blockchains giving the authority to only those people which the company wants to view the blockchain.
* Secondly the modular structure helps you to make your own decisions as to what you want in your blockchain and what not.
* It has a huge backing from many big companies like IBM, Intel Cisco etc.
* It has its own smart contracts “chaincode” to be used.

### Cons
* It doesnot has its own cryptocurrency and it requires a lot of development resources to develop one using Hyperledger chaincode.
* Its relatively new and is still under development.


## Ethereum

### Pros
* The biggest positive point about Ethereum is that it has its own cryptocurrency Ether which is the base to create and other cryptocurrency as it will be built over ether.
* It also has its own smart contracts “Solidity” written in Turing.

### Cons
* It only as public blockchains like Bitcoin, Though there is a difference and its better written than bitcoin but still it comes under and bit of weak point when it comes to block chains.
* It has a generic structure.
* As all the new cryptocurrencies are based on Ether there growth and fall also depends on Ether as the value of ether is tied to Ethereum, so if in future some other blockchain replaces Ethereum the value of Ether nad the subsequent cryptocurrencies will also fall.

## R3 Corda

### Pros
* It gives immutable ledger entries making it easier to do analysis of the data.
* No account system makes it easier to run parallel transactions.
* Transactional ordering becomes trivial.

### Cons
* Representing numeric amounts using immutable entries is unnatural. That means to consume a part of amount the user would have to make two transactions one to the person and the second to himself for the remaining amount.
* Needs a wallet system to maintain the balance of the user that needs to be created over the ledger as you can read users balance directly out of the system.
* Though the transaction can be made in parallel but they are very difficult to be made in parallel because of the strict ordering system.

## Ripple

### Pros
* Compared to traditional bank services, ripple transactions are secure and anonymous.
* Is being invested in by big companies like Google Ventures and Standard Chartered bank

### Cons
* It owns 70% of the coin currency that means the user do not have the full access of the ripple network.
* Cоѕt оf XRP on thе network will NOT bе given to anyone. It wіll dіѕарреаr instead, so the rіррlе’ѕ соіn іѕ оnlу gеttіng fеwеr. Nonetheless, thе time thе соіn to bе uѕеd uр is said tо bе hundrеdѕ оf уеаrѕ lаtеr.

## Recommendation

So I recommend the use of Hyperledger for this project as I think it is better suited for the project to sustain over the long period of time and also the cryptocurrency will not completely depend on the success of Hyperledger decresing the risk of the failure of the project.
