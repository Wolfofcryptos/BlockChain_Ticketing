# Spike Report

## Spike Description

Explored how the Docker works in general and its integration to the various platforms such as NodeJs also viewed some tutorials about the Blockchains and read a few Research papers about how block chains are used in cryptocurrencies and how bitcoin was flawed. Also studied about the Blockchain platforms Hypeledger and Ethereum.


## Pros and Cons

Out of the two main platforms to develop block chains there are pros and cons of both the platforms.

## Hyperledger

### Pros
*The biggest positive point of the Hyperledger that I found was the ability to create private blockchains giving the authority to only those people which the company wants to view the blockchain.
*Secondly the modular structure helps you to make your own decisions as to what you want in your blockchain and what not.
*It has a huge backing from many big companies like IBM, Intel Cisco etc.
*It has its own smart contracts “chaincode” to be used.

### Cons
*It doesnot has its own cryptocurrency and it requires a lot of development resources to develop one using Hyperledger chaincode.
*Its relatively new and is still under development.


## Ethereum

### Pros
*The biggest positive point about Ethereum is that it has its own cryptocurrency Ether which is the base to create and other cryptocurrency as it will be built over ether.
*It also has its own smart contracts “Solidity” written in Turing.

### Cons
*It only as public blockchains like Bitcoin, Though there is a difference and its better written than bitcoin but still it comes under and bit of weak point when it comes to block chains.
*It has a generic structure.
*As all the new cryptocurrencies are based on Ether there growth and fall also depends on Ether as the value of ether is tied to Ethereum, so if in future some other blockchain replaces Ethereum the value of Ether nad the subsequent cryptocurrencies will also fall.


## Recommendation

So I recommend the use of Hyperledger for this project as I think it is better suited for the project to sustain over the long period of time and also the cryptocurrency will not completely depend on the success of Hyperledger decresing the risk of the failure of the project.
